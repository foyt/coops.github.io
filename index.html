          <h3><a id="so-how-it-is-different" class="anchor" href="#so-how-it-is-different" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So how it's different from all the other cool collaboration thingies in the internet?</h3>
          <p>It's true that for example <a href="http://etherpad.org/">Etherpad</a> is quite well-known open-source tool for collaborating documents and everyone knows that you can edit simultaneously pretty much anything with <a href="http://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a></p>
          <h4>So what makes CoOps any different from those?</h4>
          <p>Well, first of all it's a <i><b>protocol</b></i> not an application. That means that developers can any kind of collaboration applications <i>on top of it</i></p> 
          <h4>Does that mean that i can not edit a document with my friends using CoOps</h4>
          <p>Yes and no. Yes, you can not edit anything with a protocol but you can use one of the applications build on top of it. Here's a small list of applications powered by CoOps:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://demo.coops.pw">CoOps demo</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p><i>Btw. If your application is missing from the list, please drop me an email at development(at)foyt.fi and i will gladly add it here</i></p>
          <h4>So can i create an application using the CoOps?</h4>
          <p>Now we are talking! First of all you should check out specifications from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/foyt/coops-spec">https://github.com/foyt/coops-spec</a></p>
          <p>After reading that you should have pretty good picture how the protocol works.</p>
      
          <h4>So i need a Server</h4>
          <p>Yes, That right! You need a server. Currently there's no general fits-for-all server available but don't worry, it's not even nearly as hard as you think to roll your own.</p>
          <p>It's true that creating a collaboration server could be a pain but it's not because we already have two separate example implementations that will make server implementation much easier. Here you go:</p>
