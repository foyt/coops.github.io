          <h3><a id="so-how-it-is-different" class="anchor" href="#so-how-it-is-different" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So how it's different from all the other cool collaboration thingies in the internet?</h3>
          <p>It's true that for example <a href="http://etherpad.org/">Etherpad</a> is quite well-known open-source tool for collaborating documents and everyone knows that you can edit simultaneously pretty much anything with <a href="http://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a></p>
          <h4>So what makes CoOps any different from those?</h4>
          <p>Well, first of all it's a <i><b>protocol</b></i> not an application. That means that developers can build any kind of collaboration applications <i>on top of it</i></p> 
          <p>CoOps is designed to be extremely easy to implement, in both server and client side and because it's based on text patches you can create an editor for pretty much anything you wish</p>
          <p>It's also free, open and you can participate into it's development if you wish</p>
          <h4>Does that mean that i can not edit a document with my friends using CoOps</h4>
          <p>Yes and no. Yes, you can not edit anything with a protocol but you can use an applications build on top of it. You can for example try it on the <a href="http://demo.coops.pw">CoOps demo</a></p>
          <p><i>Btw. If you have created an application and wish it to be listed here, please drop me an email at development(at)foyt.fi or add an issue into <a href="https://github.com/foyt/coops.github.io/issues">https://github.com/foyt/coops.github.io/issues</a> and i will gladly add it here</i></p>
          <h4>So can i create an application using the CoOps?</h4>
          <p>Now we are talking! First of all you should check out specifications from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/foyt/coops-spec">https://github.com/foyt/coops-spec</a></p>
          <p>After reading that you should have pretty good picture how the protocol works.</p>
      
          <h4>So i need a Server</h4>
          <p>Yes, That right! You need a server. Currently there's no general fits-for-all server available but don't worry, it's not even nearly as hard as you think to roll your own.</p>
          <p>It's true that creating a collaboration server could be a pain but it's not because we already have two separate example implementations that will make server implementation much easier. Here you go:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a hreF="https://github.com/otavanopisto/coops-quickstart" target="_blank">Quick start for CoOps Java server</a></li>
            <li><a hreF="https://github.com/foyt/coops-demo" target="_blank">CoOps Demo (NodeJs)</a></li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>...and i need a client</h4>
          <p>Awesome! You are getting hang of it. Depending on what the client should be able to do it can be either quite tricky or very easy (keep in mind that CoOps has been developed simplicity in mind)</p>
          <p>You can of course roll your own client or use one of already existing projects:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://ckeditor.com/addon/coops">CoOps add-on for CKEditor (Rich text editor)</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/foyt/coops-demo">CoIllusionist image editor (as part of CoOps demo)</a></li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><i>If you happen to create an awesome CoOps server or client, drop me an email at development(at)foyt.fi or better yet open a ticket into <a href="https://github.com/foyt/coops.github.io/issues">https://github.com/foyt/coops.github.io/issues</a> so i can add it to this list</i></p>

          <h4>Shut up and take my money!</h4>
          <p>Umm.. no, i don't need your money but i would make very happy if you would join CoOps development by for example creating your own implementation or improving an existing one</p>
